# JavaScript Password Generator

## Description

Secure passwords are the first step to securing an individuals privacy and protecting sensitive information. This webpage randomly generates a password based on the user's criteria. Reusing personal passwords is becoming increasingly less secure. In a world of social media, bad actors can easily decipher a password based on information found publicly. However, a randomly generated password eliminates that risk. By randomly selecting from a string of characters, the result is a strong password that diminishes the likelyhood of a breach into the user's account. While completing this project I learned the correct use of if statements and the use concat.  



## Usage

To use this webpage, there is a red button to start the generate password process. 
When clicking on the red button, a pop up will appear and ask for the length of the password. The length must be at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. After entering the length of the password, four more pop up's will follow asking the type of characters that should be included. At the end of the last pop up after confirming or declining, the randomly generated password will display inside the box that says Your Secure Password.
